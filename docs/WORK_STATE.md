## CURRENT 2026-10-11 — Yandex route checks expanded

- **DONE — read-only route controls:** Yandex checks now include disputed alternatives Казань—Набережные Челны (~90/278 ₽) and СПб—Кронштадт (~600/300 ₽), plus long controls СПб—Москва (~6 150 ₽), Москва—Казань (~5 250 ₽), Москва↔Краснодар (~5 530/~5 260 ₽). Older M1/M3 checks remain documented. Exact observations, limitations and failed A-289 endpoint resolution are in `experiments/nationwide-tolls/RECONCILIATION_2026-10-11.md`.
- **INTERPRETATION:** these are route estimates for passenger car <2 m/no transponder; they do not certify per-gate tariffs or operator receipts. Route alternatives/direction deltas are unresolved checks, not billing corrections. A-289 not confirmed by the malformed endpoint. No all-network coverage claim.
- **DONE — docs persisted:** reconciliation appended and work log updated; latest audit commit `79b86c99654d072597c438e7027f4037cfb6ca47` (includes reconciliation, work log, next-step priority and this handoff). No code/tariff change. No tests/build/deploy run (docs-only research). Existing branch Preview remains on earlier source SHA; production untouched.
- **NEXT:** resolve each materially divergent route against exact selected geometry, dated operator tariffs and matching official trip calculator/receipt; expand targeted Yandex checks for open network groups listed in `NEXT_STEPS.md`. Never convert estimates directly to live prices.
